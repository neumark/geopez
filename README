GeoPez

It takes a set of geotagged images and a downloaded prezi.
It adds the images, positioning them according to the geolocations.
It also adds a static google maps image that covers the locations.

Installation

You need numpy and PIL for this. On a mac this worked:

pip intall numpy
pip install --no-index -f http://dist.plone.org/thirdparty/ -U PIL

On windows machines it didn't.

The included EXIF.py code is taken from
https://github.com/ianare/exif-py
It also has weird problems under windows.

How to run this thing?

First put a starting prezi under ../examples/emptyprezi
../examples/emptyprezi/content/data/content.xml
should be there if you do it right.

Make a copy so that you can revert to it later:
cp -r ../examples/emptyprezi ../examples/emptyprezi.original

Suppose the geotagged pics are in the pics/ directory.

python geopez.py ../examples/emptyprezi "pics/2012-11-29 19.48.08.jpg" "pics/2012-12-30 10.49.44.jpg" "pics/2012-12-31 11.03.40.jpg" > foo
mv foo ../examples/emptyprezi/content/data/content.xml
open ../examples/emptyprezi/Prezi.app

If we want to try it again, we copy the original xml back.
(We don't deal with the images because they don't cause any trouble)
cp ../examples/emptyprezi.original/content/data/content.xml ../examples/emptyprezi/content/data/content.xml

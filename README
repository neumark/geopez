GeoPez

It takes a set of geotagged images and a downloaded prezi.
It adds the images, positioning them according to the geolocations.
It also adds a static google maps image that covers the locations.

Installation

You need numpy and PIL for this. On a mac this worked:

pip intall numpy
pip install --no-index -f http://dist.plone.org/thirdparty/ -U PIL

Arguments

GeoPez takes three arguments:

input--portable Prezi that the map and pictures will be added to
output--directory for the portable Prezi produced by GeoPez. If this directory exists, it will be overwritten.
images--this directory will be scanned for geotagged images to include (with a map) in the new Prezi. Subdirectories and files without the following tags are ignored:

GPS GPSLatitude
GPS GPSLongitude
EXIF DateTimeOriginal
EXIF ExifImageWidth
EXIF ExifImageLength

Altogether you should run it with something like this:

python geopez.py inputPortablePrezi whereOutputShouldGo images
